why does the entry point of a program in the VS community on my machine have to be .cpp cant be .h "error an unresolved symbol in
	- I think i know why, because .h the declaration &blueprint of a program while .cpp is the actual translation unit the system compiles. .h are normally used as include file to tell the system that some particular symbols (function, variables, etc) occur during compilation and after the linker looks for them and links them up.

Shader code error message printing 
		//TO-DO: Need to fix the debug message (for easy debugging)
		//current issue: misspelt a data type (sampler as sample) wrong error message
		//Error message was generic syntax error, unexpected IDENTIFIER, expecting
		// LEFT_BRACE or COMMA or SEMICOLON.


Shader language/File/GLSL
		when a shader file/program is compiled if a variable is declared but not used use in the program
		it gets striped out noticed with uniform i declared without using it.

Shader Files 
	Move shader files from src/ShaderFile 
	into Asset folder

FPS issue
	with main scene runs at 1100 FPS 
	while Texture Framebuffers scene runs at 167 - 220 FPS, have up 3 render passes. but when most of the objects in the scene is culled frame goes up to 1000 FPS


NaÃ¯ve Scene Loading
	- Have new Feature called "Scene Loading".
	- With the Scene Loading documentation state the previous version before changing to a functional one. 

Rendering Primitives
	- Line, Triangle, Line_strip etc

Experiment with the CPU's Transposing Model vertex (for scaled &/ rotated models) to avoid complex/expensive inverse matrix calculation in GPU shader.

Fixed Issue: Orthographic Camera Frustrum Debugger(Visualization) 
	The near plane needs to be offset forward in the direction of the camera & same direction of the far plane not to be behind the camera point. 

Issue: (Scaling AABB relationship it model/mesh), Problem if the origin is not at the geometric center of the model, The AABB scale asymmetrically, leading to incorrect bounds. i.e When scaling a model with an offset(/model origin not at center) with current algorithm using vector scaling the AABB based on the ratio of the model scale, since the center point/origin of model is different from the AABB center it scales different. Might want to fix with Matrix Transformation

Later Fix Point Shadow method 
	- To only have one shader for handling and writing depth into CubeMap
	- Have a centralised storage for common / generalised data like near, far 
	- Only store unique data if necessary like light space matrix
	- fix direction for scene capture 

Tangent Space
	- model normal map is in a tangent map and then transformed into world space. For
		- Light modelling using TBN (tangent bitangent normal) matrix from model space.
		- mat TBN = mat3(t, b, n). where all elements t, b, n are translated based on model in model space.
			- i.e t = model * tangent; etc 
		- all vectors (t, b, n) are perpendicular to each other, i.e having t, n ,  b = cross(n, t);
	- Important for Parallax mapping, 
		- All calculation of height is performed in tangent space before converting to world space pixel/point 

ISSUE ISSE >> FIXED
	- problem with trying to pass a float as an int, but find a way to redirect/cast type


NEED TO WORK ON (MESH THAT DOES NOT HAVE TANGENT & BITANGENT) algorithm to calculate them. 
RETHINK ENTITY GET WORLD TRANSFORM - should the transform be updated if dirty upon retrieval or updated immediately when dirty/updated at the start/end of the frame? This would make it nice to have the function has const. 

MATERIAL DUPLICATE ON LOAD: prevent model/entity to have duplicate material. if mesh tries to use use a similar material already generated don't create a new one
